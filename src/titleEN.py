EAGLE = """
<div class="story-box font-body">
<p>
Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. 
Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related. 
Most of the 60 species of eagle are from Eurasia and Africa. 
Outside this area, just 14 species can be found — 2 in North America, 9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia.
<br /><br />
Eagles aren't a natural group but denote essentially any bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable (about 50cm long or more overall) vertebrate.

<p>
Flamingos or flamingoes are a type of wading bird in the family Phoenicopteridae, 
which is the only extant family in the order Phoenicopteriformes. 
There are four flamingo species distributed throughout the Americas (including the Caribbean), 
and two species native to Africa, Asia, and Europe.
<br /><br />
The name flamingo comes from Portuguese or Spanish flamengo ("flame-colored"), 
which in turn comes from Provençal flamenc - a combination of flama ("flame") and a Germanic-like suffix -ing.

<p>
The Eurasian golden oriole (Oriolus oriolus) also called golden oriole, 
is the only member of the Old World oriole family of passerine birds breeding in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions. 
It is a summer migrant in Europe and Palearctic and spends the winter season in central and southern Africa.
<br /><br />
Golden orioles have an extremely large range with large populations that are apparently stable. 
Therefore, they are evaluated as least concern by BirdLife International.

HYACINTH_MACAW = """
<div class="story-box font-body">
<p>
The hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), or hyacinthine macaw, is a parrot native to central and eastern South America. 
With a length (from the top of its head to the tip of its long pointed tail) of about one meter it is longer than any other species of parrot. 
It is the largest macaw and the largest flying parrot species; the flightless kākāpō of New Zealand outweighs it at up to 3.5 kg. 
While generally easily recognized, it could be confused with the smaller Lear's macaw.
<br /><br />
Habitat loss and the trapping of wild birds for the pet trade have taken a heavy toll on their population in the wild, 
so the species is classified as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, 
and it is protected by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.

MUTE_SWAN = """
<div class="story-box font-body">
<p>
The mute swan (Cygnus olor) is a species of swan and a member of the waterfowl family Anatidae. 
It is native to much of Eurosiberia, and the far north of Africa. 
It is an introduced species in North America, home to the largest populations outside of its native range, 
with additional smaller introductions in Australasia and southern Africa. 
The name 'mute' derives from it being less vocal than other swan species.
<br /><br />
Measuring 125 to 170cm in length, this large swan is wholly white in plumage with an orange beak bordered with black. 
It is recognisable by its pronounced knob atop the beak, which is larger in males.

SEAGULL = """
<div class="story-box font-body">
<p>
Gulls, or colloquially seagulls, are seabirds of the family Laridae in the suborder Lari. 
They are most closely related to the terns and skimmers and only distantly related to auks, and even more distantly to waders. 
Until the 21st century, most gulls were placed in the genus Larus, but that arrangement is now considered polyphyletic, leading to the resurrection of several genera.
<br /><br />
An older name for gulls is mews, which is cognate with German Möwe, Danish måge, Swedish mås, Dutch meeuw, Norwegian måke/måse and French mouette, and can still be found in certain regional dialects.
